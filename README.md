## Recreate my Tosti application
Before I started building this application, I started with tutorials about React. After the tutorial was finished, I wanted a refresher course about Vanilla JavaScript and EJS6. 

#### First step
The first step was to create the document and install the required packages:
* SASS 
* React-Routing

After the packages are installed, I set the structure of my application:
* public
	* index.html
* src
	* assets
		* svg
		* png
		* jpg
	* components
		* All the builded components.js
	* pages
		* All the pages in the application
	* sass
		* Styling files
	* index.js
* gitignore
* package.json

#### Seconds step
The next step after the structure was set and the packages were installed, was to render the visible components. Before making it works and interact, I started with displaying en showing images, buttons and forms. 

#### Third step
When everything was showing and rendering in the application, started with creating the interaction between each component. The first thing was to let the user click on a button and going to the next page. 

After the first interaction works, was the next interaction to click on a form input and display the chosen element into a list. The next interaction was to copy the rendered list into the clipboard from the user and to empty the list.

#### Nice to have
When everything works like my old application that I builded. I wanted to add a new feature, namely: the user can type their own words to add into the listitem. 

#### Finished product
See here my application:
